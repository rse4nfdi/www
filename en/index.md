# Research Software Engineers for the national research-data infrastructure

We are convinced that research software as crosscutting theme is important enough to establish
a dedicated consortium within the NFDI initiative: ***Research Software Engineers for the national research-data infrastructure***.

# Einladung zur Teilnahme

Everyone who is interested in sustainability of research software, or who depends on it is invited to [join RSE4NFDI](join.html).
