# Objectives

RSE4NFDI aims to ensure software sustainability across scientific disciplines in the context of research data management on a national level. It addresses those in research who develop and use research software and in this course acquire, handle, store and provide scientific data. The expertise and provided support and services will be complemented by the development and implementation of required and commonly accepted framing conditions. Taken together, the RSE4NFDI activities will ensure sustainable handling of research software corresponding to the FAIR principles.

RSE4NFDI against the background of research data management is going to

* provide a research-oriented service-, procedure- and knowledge-portfolio 
* develop in a demand-oriented manner
* constitute an pan-German competence network with regards to institutions and human resources
* dynamically advance standards
* foster interoperability and convergences across NFDI-consortia
* support integration into international research data infrastructures

RSE4NFDI is not:

*	merely a “portal”
* a small network with few centers
* a platfrom to consolidate software projects
